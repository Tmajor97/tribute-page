<p><strong>July 2003:</strong> Arrested in Eagle, Colorado, as part of an investigation of a sexual assault complaint filed by a 19-year-old hotel employee. The charges were dropped 14 months later and after his accuser filed a civil suit, they reached a settlement.</p>

<p><strong>April 13, 2016:</strong> In his final NBA game, Bryant put forth a vintage performance, scoring 60 points against the Jazz in a 101-96 Lakers win, becoming the oldest player in NBA history to score 60 in a game. That is also the most points any NBA player has ever scored in his final game. He finished his career with 33,643 points, which was third in NBA history until James surpassed the mark on Jan. 25, 2020.
